##My App Idea
I am colorbind gamer and find it hard to play certain games because I am incapable of seeing things on a map, it made me start thinking about others with different diabilities and how their playtime may be made difficult. As a result, I would like to make an app that has a good UI/UX design for those who has auditory issues. It'd have more interactions shown on the map, and have more instructions that're written instead of being said on 'how to play'. The game will feature no auditory indication of enemies nearby but rather red/green arrows that tell a user where an enemy/friendly is coming from. I personally know how it feels to not be able to play a well known game because you'd be at a disadvantage from the get-go so hopefully I can take this certification, and learn how to start up the app to make it a reality for those with an auditory diability.

## Notes
I had no challenges while building the app
